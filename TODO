Things to fix:

* cmdline kernel config parameter changing

* delete unused stuff in gmi/

* make some functions more generic .. ( not necessary right away but would be nice to get done )

* kbuild output writeable check

* make critical variables (arch, etc) bombproof and readonly so modules can't b0rk things
  up

* --list-module-groups for gmi

gmi: We need modules in the sense that you can just add an overlay and the
     initramfs scripts will pick up the .sh and run it.

busybox: fix config (add --busybox-networking opt or something)

general: "Failed to compile" errors need to produce backtrace & etc...
makeopts work?

* reduce --help indentation to make things more readable
* --help should go to stderr
* udhcp.sh should print out IP address received and such
* console=ttyS0,9600 goes kaboom
