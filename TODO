Things to fix:

* fix manpage [plasmaroo]
* busybox config file
* always install modules?

* epatch function

* < Chacabaou> plasmaroo: Well... you _could_ kinda improve genkernel to prevent dumbasses 
               like me from doing such shit like setting up a LVM without activation LVM in the kernel.
